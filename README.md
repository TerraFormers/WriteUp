The project DIALOC is a fun app to allow people to enter their favorite locations and find the exact opposite point on the other side of the globe/planet Earth. It allows for many users to also favorite these locations and see the street view. We used the Agile workflow, approved by Aaron, and kept front-end seprate from back-end going into the first few days.

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, nodejs, Git, jQuery, PostgreSQL, knex.js, Express, Java, WebGL, Materialize, JWT, Firebase, and Heroku.
